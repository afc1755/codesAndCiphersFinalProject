# Final Project for Codes and Ciphers: MATH-367
Mini-DES and DES project code for MATH-367
Created by: Andrew Chabot and John Shull

Running the project

The main ruinnable code is the miniDES.py file.
You are only required to have python3 and the bitarray package installed to run this code.
The project includes code for running mini DES in verbose mode using a random key as well as a program for cracking the key used in the encryption given a binary plaintext and ciphertext.
To run the verbose mini-DES mode, type 'v' on input in the program. 
To run the key crack code, type 'c' for program input.
